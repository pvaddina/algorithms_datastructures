# Algorithms and Datastructures

My implementation, testing and validation of several elementary algorithms and basic data structures. These implementations are also verified and benchmarked, mostly against their corresponding std implementations. All these implementations are at a nascent stage of their development, and are constantly evolving. So do expect issues if anyone want to use it. Find more details about individual projects in the respective directories.

It goes without saying that all the benchmarks need to be swallowed with a pinch of salt and should not be taken literally.
